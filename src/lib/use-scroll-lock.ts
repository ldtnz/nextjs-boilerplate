/**
 * Holds the page still while a dialog is open.
 *
 * `overflow: hidden` on the body is the usual answer and is not enough:
 * Safari on iOS goes on scrolling the page behind the dialog regardless, so
 * dismissing a confirmation could leave the page somewhere else entirely.
 * Taking the body out of flow and pinning it at the offset it was already at
 * is what holds everywhere; the offset is restored on release, so nothing
 * jumps when the dialog closes.
 *
 * Counted rather than toggled: dialogs do open over each other (a
 * confirmation from a dialog, a video from a details view), and the first
 * one to close must not hand the page back while another is still up.
