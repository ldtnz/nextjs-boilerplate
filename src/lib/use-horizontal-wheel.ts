/**
 * Lets a sideways-scrolling row be scrolled with an ordinary mouse wheel.
 *
 * A trackpad sends a horizontal delta of its own, so two-finger swiping over
 * such a row works on a Mac without any help. A wheel only sends `deltaY`,
 * and no browser turns that into horizontal movement on its own: the event
 * finds nothing vertical to scroll here and chains to the page instead, so
 * the row looks frozen. Shift+wheel does work, but nobody discovers that.
 *
 * The delta is only consumed while there is somewhere to go in that
 * direction; at either end the event is left alone so the page scrolls as it
 * would have. The listener is registered by hand rather than through `onWheel`
 * because React attaches wheel handlers passively, where `preventDefault` is
 * ignored.
 *
 * A callback ref rather than an effect over a ref object, because a row does
 * not always exist when its component first mounts: a dialog that shows a
 * skeleton until its data arrives renders the row later, and an effect that read the ref once
 * found nothing there and never looked again — that row scrolled by touch and
 * ignored the wheel entirely. This attaches whenever the node appears and
 * detaches with it (React 19 runs the returned cleanup when the ref is
 * released).
