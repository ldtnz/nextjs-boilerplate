/**
 * Writes docs/schema.sql: every migration, in order, as one file to paste.
 *
 * The setup guide's easy path is Turso's own SQL console — no clone, no npm,
 * no CLI — which needs the schema as a single block of SQL someone can copy.
 * Keeping that block by hand is how it goes stale: a migration is added, the
 * file is not, and the next person to follow the guide ends up with an app
 * that errors on a column nobody told them about.
 *
 * So it is generated from prisma/migrations, and a test compares the committed
 * file against a fresh run — meaning a forgotten regeneration fails the suite
 * rather than a stranger's install.
 *
 * Run with: npm run db:sql
